# 🪑 PneumaStool: Tailored Fiber Placement for Soft-Actuated Structure

## Project Overview

**PneumaStool** explores a fabrication method that combines tailored fiber placement (TFP) and soft pneumatic actuation to actuate a 2D chair into a lightweight, structurally performative stool. The aim was to integrate the structural advantages of fiber-reinforced polymers with the forming capabilities of inflatable structures.

This project was developed under the topic:  
🧵 *“TFP – Integration of Electronics and Soft Actuators”*, following BioMat’s philosophy of **“Materials as a Design Tool.”**

### Core Concept

- Soft actuators replaced *formwork* during deployment.
- Tailored fiber placement (TFP) was used to reinforce the structure after inflation.
- This hybrid approach enables complex geometries with minimal material waste and high structural performance.

### My Contribution

I was responsible for:
- Designing the **fiber placement pattern** on a flat 2D chair layout using Grasshopper.
- Exploring patterning strategies to influence the structural and bending behavior during inflation.
